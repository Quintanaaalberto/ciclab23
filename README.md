## **MAJOR UPDATE 10th july 2023: first steps**

Welcome to the first update on this projects repository.

### 1. **Repo structural changes**:

- creation of *src* folder
- creation of *docs* folder

The *src* folder will contain most coe snippets that have been designed by us and algorithms that are being tested and/or designed.
The *docs* folder will contain most of the documentation we find along the way that is available as code, docs or books.

### 2. Upload of the first algorithm:

- version 0 of our edge detection algorithm is deployed and is comprised mostly of the tutorial on this algorithm
- version 1 is in the making called "bigger" and is part of an attempt to analyse bigger images
